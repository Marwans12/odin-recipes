    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is my version of a tuna pasta dish with capers, 
        anchovies, and tomatoes. I make it at least once 
        a week as it is my husband's favorite and he 
        proclaims it's restaurant quality. You can easy 
        double the recipe if you're cooking for more people.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ (16 ounce) box penne</li>
        <li>1 (5 ounce) can tuna, packed in olive oil, drained</li>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>¼ cup finely chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>½ large organic lemon, juiced and zested</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 ounce canned anchovy fillets, drained</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons capers</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>½ bunch fresh parsley, finely chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water 
                to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring 
                occasionally, until tender yet firm to the 
                bite, about 11 minutes.</li>
            <li>Empty tuna into a bowl and mash with a fork 
                while pasta is cooking. Mix with 2 
                tablespoons olive oil, basil, lemon juice, 
                lemon zest, salt, and pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil 
                in a large skillet and fry the anchovies 
                for 3 minutes. Add capers and garlic; cook, 
                stirring constantly, for an additional 3 
                minutes. Add tuna mixture and tomatoes; 
                simmer sauce for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain pasta and add to the sauce. Mix well. 
                Stir in parsley before serving.</li>
        </ol>
